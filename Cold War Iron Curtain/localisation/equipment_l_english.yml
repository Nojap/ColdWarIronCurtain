In combat, the M5 Stuart’s small cannon proved to be a significant shortcoming, especially in the North African campaign.

It is armed with a 76mm main gun, a .30 cal coaxial machine gun, and a .50 cal roof gun. It uses a Continental 6 cylinder petrol engine and runs up to 45 mph with an operational range of 100 miles. The development of the M41 was progressing slowly with little funding but when the Korean War broke out, the US army began rushing the program. The rushing caused a large number of problems in the program and oversize issues. The M41, as a result of severe problems stemming from the rushing of the program, was produced for a very short time and did not see usage during the Korean war. In fact, production did not start until 1951 and only lasted 3 years."

Very little information is available on the prototype, but it was designed as an airborne tank that could be airdropped and weighed only 15 tons. The T92 is primarily based off of the Soviet PT92 design. The T92 saw combat during testing exercises and the War Over The Last Donut in the Mess Hall. The WOTLD occurred when 2 of the testing crew verbally argued over who is the bigger fatass and who should get the donut.

The armor is an aluminum hull with a steel turret. It was immediately rushed into service in Vietnam because of its mobility and versatility where it served an exceptional role. The 152mm main gun can launch an ATGM or conventional ammunition respectively. The M551 was criticized by many of its operators due to the difficulty of use in direct combat but still served its role effectively despite its poor reputation."

 USA_lt_equipment_6_desc:0 "The M8 AGS Buford is an experimental recon tank designed by Cadillac in the late 1990s, but the project was cancelled. Due to the M8s cancellation and the cessation of production of the M551 in 1997, there was a long period of time where the US was without any recon tanks. It would not be until 2016 where the M1128 would eventually begin production to fill that role. The M8 would have had aluminum armor and a 105mm main gun with long-range anti-tank capability. The engine in the prototypes varied greatly and no engine was settled although the 6V 92TIA from the Detroit Diesel Corporation was the best candidate that had an offroad speed of 30 miles per hour. The tank first saw combat in some fields outside Detroit where the prototypes were tested and then again when an officer from the local base got approval to take it for a joyride and he accidentally ran over a squirrel."

The EFVP-1 used a MT 883 ka engine although it was like that it would use a different engine as production went on. It is capable of travelling 75 miles in water at an impressive swimming speed of 28.6 mph. The vehicle would have also featured an IFV style turret for added fire support. The exact armaments are unknown but it could potentially hold anything from autocannons to ATGMs. The project costed 3 billion to develop but was eventually cancelled as it was estimated to cost an additional 12 billion to create the remainder of what the vehicle was desired to do. It saw combat in the proving ground pool when a piece of it came off during testing and one of the designers, angry that it did this again, kicked it hard enough to break his foot. "

 SOV_lt_equipment_1_short:0 "T-60"
 SOV_lt_equipment_1_desc:0 "The T60 was a light tank manufactured to replace the T-38 in its recon role. It was designed in 1941 by Nicholas Astrov and 6,300 were produced in the 2 years it was produced.. The vehicle was a 2 crew tank with a 6 cylinder engine and reaches up to 44 km/h with a 20mm main gun. It was used extensively during WWII."
 SOV_lt_equipment_2:0 "T-70"
 SOV_lt_equipment_2_short:0 "T-70"
 SOV_lt_equipment_2_desc:0 "The T-70 light tank was a WWII scout tank manufactured to replace the PT60. Nicholas Astrov began work immediately after the PT60 and finished in 1942. In the 2 years it was manufactured, 8,300 were produced. The tank had a much larger 45mm gun and came with 2 GAZ-202 engines and could reach up to 45 km/h. The T-70 also had nominally improved optic capability It was used extensively during WWII."
 SOV_lt_equipment_3:0 "PT-76"
 SOV_lt_equipment_3_short:0 "PT-76"
 SOV_lt_equipment_3_desc:0 "The PT76 is a Soviet amphibious light tank and was heavily exported around the world. It was designed by N Shashmyrin and Zh Kotin in 1951 and around 12,000 units were made. It requires a 3 man crew and a V6 straight six engine with a speed of 44 km/h and can swim at 10 km/h. It was exported to various Soviet-sphere and Soviet-leaning countries and as such as seen a recon role in virtually all conflicts of Soviet-sphere nations. However, it is still in use by many countries today due to its famous reliability and ease of maintenance."
 SOV_lt_equipment_4:0 "PT-71"
 SOV_lt_equipment_4_short:0 "PT-71"
 SOV_lt_equipment_4_desc:0 "The PT71 is an improvement made off of the PT76. The improvement was made by N Shashmyrin and Zh Kotin in the late 60s, and is equipped with an anti-tank guided missile. This, however, added more weight. It did not see mass production as the Soviet general staff didn’t see a reason to sacrifice speed for a stronger gun on a scout tank. "
 SOV_lt_equipment_5:0 "PT-85"
 SOV_lt_equipment_5_short:0 "PT-85"
 SOV_lt_equipment_5_desc:0 "The PT-85 is an improved version of the PT-76 made by the North Korean Military Design Bureau [Exact name unknown]. It has a lengthened chassis an a stronger, improved turret. It also has a larger main gun, a 85mm. The engine was also optimized to increase speed along with the increased weight. It also contained the ATGM that was initially intended to be added to the PT71. The tank’s design was not manufactured outside of the DPRK and as such, has not seen any known combat."

 SOV_lt_equipment_6_desc:0 "The 2525 SPRUT-SD is a Russian amphibious light tank designed created by the Volgograd Tractor Plant. The 125mm smoothbore main gun is built to engage enemy tanks and fire AP rounds. It has a 510 horsepower diesel engine and can operate at speeds up to 70 km/h and swims at 10 km/h. It also features Hydropneumatic suspension with variable height controls allowing it to adapt to many different environments and not lose too much speed. In extremely rough terrain, it can move at speeds up to 45 km/h, giving it versatility in different rough environments. It is deployed by the Russians but as not seen any known combat."

 SOV_mbt_equipment_0_short:0 "T-34-85"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_0_desc:0 "The T-34 is a Soviet medium tank that revolutionized the field of tank design and is well known for its reliability. The T-34 was designed in 1940 by KMBD in the Soviet Union. In an attempt to reduce costs, the sloped armor was introduced into the tank’s design. However, this also led to the tank itself becoming far better protected as well as less expensive with a smaller surface area. The weapon itself is 76.2mm gun and had nominal ammunition carrying capacity. However, the sights and vision devices were notably poor making it difficult for tank commanders to operate and their poor coordination capability cut down a lot of the advantages the tank itself provided. The T-34 became the second most produced tank in the world but one of the most important in WWII. T-34s are still being used by insurgents and poorer nations today."
 SOV_mbt_equipment_1:0 "T-44"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_1_short:0 "T-44"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_1_desc:0 "The T-44 is a medium Soviet tank made closer to the end of WWII. It provided improved mobility and greater armor with a heavier 85mm main gun. It was designed by AA Morozov in 1944 however few were built as the tank was seen as too expensive for what advantages they provided. Only 2000 were built before production switched back to the T-34."
 SOV_mbt_equipment_2:0 "T-54"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_2_short:0 "T-54"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_2_desc:0 "The T-54 tank was the most produced tank in history. The tank was designed in 1946 by by KMBD. The tank itself uses a 100mm rifled gun and has varying armor thicknesses that ranges from 205mm to 60mm. The engine itself is a 38.88 liter V-12 diesel engine and the tank uses torsion bar suspension and was capable of speeds up to 48 km/h. The tank itself was used in more than 50 armies worldwide and saw production throughout the entire soviet sphere and all of their conflicts along with it. "
 SOV_mbt_equipment_3:0 "T-55"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_3_short:0 "T-55"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_3_desc:0 "The T-55 is an improved version of the T-54 tank. OKB-520 modified the T-55 design by improving NBC protection, giving it a more optimized engine, improving the turret shape, and even added more auxiliary equipment such as improved fire control and optics. Additionally, the T-55 used the 12.7 DShK HMG more often whereas the T-54 used the 7.62 SGMT gun, granting it more firepower but barring it from carrying more ammunition. The T-55 was used in just as many armies and typically saw all the conflicts that the T-54 saw. "
 SOV_mbt_equipment_4:0 "T-62"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_4_short:0 "T-62"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_4_desc:0 "The T-62 is a further development of the T-55 tank. The T-62 uses a smoothbore gun and has slightly thicker armor. The main gun was also upped to 115mm. It was initially commissioned by the Soviet Union in an attempt to improve its firepower and the OKB-520 design bureau finished the project around 1960. Although an improvement, production was not phased out as its cost was nominally higher than that of the T-55. More than 22,700 T-62s were manufactured and it saw vast amounts of combat throughout the Soviet sphere but has seen conflict mostly in the middle east. Its improvements displayed a slightly greater capability in 1969 in the Sino-Soviet border conflict. "
 SOV_mbt_equipment_5:0 "T-64"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_5_short:0 "T-64"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_5_desc:0 "The T-64 is a Soviet MBT that introduced numerous modernizations over the T-62 and can be called a continuation of the improvements made from the T-55 to the T-62. It features a more compact engine, composite armor, improved engine auxiliaries, and a 125mm main gun with an autoloader. Designed in 1962 by KMBD, the tank itself featured many improvements over its predecessor but at substantially higher costs. The engine was a 5TDF 5-cylinder diesel engine that enabled greater operational range and higher speeds. It was intended to be scrapped, but was kept in production by its chief designer’s political clout. Alexander Morozov, the chief designer, argued that in spite of its costs, it was a notably greater design that was worth it. This showed to not be the case in the war in Donbass and the war in Transnistria. It was replaced with the vastly more cost effective T-72. "
 SOV_mbt_equipment_6:0 "T-72"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_6_short:0 "T-72"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_6_desc:0 "The T-72 is a Soviet MBT created as a new generation of tanks, mostly to replace the T-62 and its expensive counterpart the T-64. It costed almost half as much as the T-64 and came with vast improvements. Its design was finished in 1973 by Leonid Venediktov and showed incredible capability. The gun and armor were still 125mm and composite respectively but with a vastly more economically feasible design that was easier to produce. The engine is a V-12 780 hp that could be later refitted with the a 1130 hp design. The tank could achieve incredible mobility achieving speeds of 80 km/h and could match harsher terrains better than the T-64. It saw usage in all soviet-sphere conflicts, unlike the T-64, and displayed incredible capability in them as well. The tank has also seen plenty of usage in out-of-sphere African, Middle Eastern, and Indochinese conflicts."
 SOV_mbt_equipment_7:0 "T-80"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_7_short:0 "T-80"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_7_desc:0 "The T-80 is a Soviet MBT designed following the doctrine of high mobility the T-72 set. The KMBD began designing it in 1964 and finished in 1975 after 11 years of work. The hull itself is made of improved, thickened composite armor and comes with an improved smoothbore gun. It also can come equipped with a rocket armament for improved firepower. It has a smaller range than the T-72 and slightly slower speeds despite having a more advanced transmission and gas turbine engine. It saw conflict in the Chechen wars and the war in Donbass but was not extensively used as much as the T-72 was."
 SOV_mbt_equipment_8:0 "T-90 (T-72BU)"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_8_short:0 "T-90"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_8_desc:0 "After the T-80 failed to replace the T-72 or display significantly greater capabilities, Kartsev-Venediktov sought to further improve the tank and introduce better capability than the T-80. The design was finished around 1990. The engine was replaced with a 12 cylinder diesel engine and was slower than even the T-80, but held much higher firepower. The gun was upgraded, the fire control system was improved, the armor was thickened substantial and many more auxiliaries were added including a ATGM jammer and smoke dischargers. It has seen combat in Dagestan and Donbass. "
 SOV_mbt_equipment_9:0 "Black Eagle"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_9_short:0 "T-95 Black Eagle"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_9_desc:0 "The T-95 Black Eagle was intended to be an improved MBT designed by KBTM in the late 1990s but has been presumably cancelled after the company went bankrupt and imploded and it was decided that the T-80s chassis, which the Black Eagle was based off of, was of low-quality. The Black Eagle would have featured Explosive Reactive armor and a much greater 152mm gun in one variant but a 120mm in another. The engine would have been a gas turbine engine with more mobility and speed than the T-90, matching up roughly to the T-80. The T-95 would take lessons from the T-90 and T-80 and create a tank that would have been more reliable than either tank. 3 prototypes were constructed."

In the 2 years it was manufactured, 8,300 were produced. The tank had a much larger 45mm gun and came with 2 GAZ-202 engines and could reach up to 45 km/h. The T-70 also had nominally improved optic capability It was used extensively during WWII."

It was designed by N Shashmyrin and Zh Kotin in 1951 and around 12,000 units were made. It requires a 3 man crew and a V6 straight six engine with a speed of 44 km/h and can swim at 10 km/h. It was exported to various Soviet-sphere and Soviet-leaning countries and as such as seen a recon role in virtually all conflicts of Soviet-sphere nations. However, it is still in use by many countries today due to its famous reliability and ease of maintenance."

 YUG_mbt_equipment_0_desc:0 "The T-34 is a Soviet medium tank that revolutionized the field of tank design and is well known for its reliability. The T-34 was designed in 1940 by KMBD in the Soviet Union. In an attempt to reduce costs, the sloped armor was introduced into the tank’s design. However, this also led to the tank itself becoming far better protected as well as less expensive with a smaller surface area. The weapon itself is 76.2mm gun and had nominal ammunition carrying capacity. However, the sights and vision devices were notably poor making it difficult for tank commanders to operate and their poor coordination capability cut down a lot of the advantages the tank itself provided. The T-34 became the second most produced tank in the world but one of the most important in WWII. T-34s are still being used by insurgents and poorer nations today."

The engine itself is a 38.88 liter V-12 diesel engine and the tank uses torsion bar suspension and was capable of speeds up to 48 km/h. The tank itself was used in more than 50 armies worldwide and saw production throughout the entire soviet sphere and all of their conflicts along with it. "

It costed almost half as much as the T-64 and came with vast improvements. Its design was finished in 1973 by Leonid Venediktov and showed incredible capability. The gun and armor were still 125mm and composite respectively but with a vastly more economically feasible design that was easier to produce. The engine is a V-12 780 hp that could be later refitted with the a 1130 hp design. The tank could achieve incredible mobility achieving speeds of 80 km/h and could match harsher terrains better than the T-64. It saw usage in all soviet-sphere conflicts, unlike the T-64, and displayed incredible capability in them as well. The tank has also seen plenty of usage in out-of-sphere African, Middle Eastern, and Indochinese conflicts."
